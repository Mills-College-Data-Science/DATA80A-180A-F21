    "## Part 3: The Nurses' Health Study\n",
    "The Nurses' Health Study (NHS) is another very large observational study which has brought many insights into women's health. It began in 1976, by Dr. Frank Speizer, with questionnaires that were mailed to 121,964 female registered nurses in the United States asking about their medical history, cholesterol and blood pressure, current medications, and so on (one of the benefits of studying nurses is their ability to give reliably accurate answers to these questions). \n",
    "\n",
    "The study's initial focus was on investigating the long-term health effects of oral contraceptives, whose use had become much more widespread in the U.S. during the 1960s, but the focus soon expanded to investigating a wide variety of questions on women's health. The NHS is still ongoing, and is now tracking its third generation of nurses in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the most consequential early findings from the NHS was about hormone replacement therapy (HRT)**: supplementary estrogen and progesterone for post-menopausal women to relieve side effects of declining hormone levels due to menopause. The NHS found that HRT in post-menopausal women was negatively associated with heart attack risk. In other words, higher levels of HRT in post-menopausal women were associated with lower risk of heart attack. In a landmark 1985 paper in the *New England Journal of Medicine* (NEJM), Speizer and his coauthors wrote that **women on HRT are half as likely to suffer a heart attack over a certain time period.** [(Stampfer et al., 1985)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4047106) We'll define the term \"relative risk\" later in this section, and we'll also investigate the interpretation of these claims and their statistical basis."

    "Partly as a result of evidence from the NHS and other observational studies that drew similar conclusions, HRT drugs became a very popular preventive treatment for doctors to prescribe to post-menopausal woman. Even though there were known or suspected risks to the treatment (such as increasing the risk of invasive breast cancer), it was thought that the reduction in heart disease risk was well worth it.\n",

These findings contradicted the results of the Nurses' Heart study, challenging the efficacy of a treatment that had become the standard of care for heart disease prevention. The HERS study authors put forward a possible answer regarding why the NHS study might be biased:\n",
    "> The observed association between estrogen therapy and reduced CHD risk might be attributable to selection bias if women who choose to take hormones are healthier and have a more favorable CHD profile than those who do not. Observational studies cannot resolve this uncertainty.\n",
